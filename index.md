FOR THIS DEMO: We've inserted a little snippet that takes away your gun after you die just so that you pay attention to our explanation. We agree, our game is amazing and addicting, but let's be respectful of our presentations.

If you are "triggered," as we in the professional gaming industry like to call it, you may sliently raise your hang into a fist, the global signal for "I'm triggered."



CHEAT: only applies to some players, picked at random; hit Q twice, hold it, and press command to get unlimited ammo.
